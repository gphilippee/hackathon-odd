"This makes tourism a co-ordination-intensive, as well as information-intensive, industry (Zhang et al. The key components of tourism are accommodation, transport, attractions and excursions, and restaurants; all are ‘perishable’. This means that airline seats, hotel rooms and daily ticket sales, for example, cannot be stored for potential future sales. This level of uncertainty, coupled with the uncertainty of global trends and exogenous shocks, has become an important area of tourism supply chain research. Areas of particular interest include demand forecasting, yield or revenue management and inventory management (Zhang et al. Finally, the supply chains in tourism that already exist are usually part of the wider global operations of major hotels and resorts (for example Hilton and Four Seasons hotels) and of cruise ship operators (for example Carnival Corporation and Royal Caribbean).",10.37,68.07,12.63,24.30,1.72,12.65,47.04,37.22,78.46,82.42,77.59,12.51
"This is a concern, as the tourism industry is highly dynamic and responsive to changing trends and markets. Tourism is the sum or final product of many highly co-ordinated products and services which include transport, accommodation and restaurants. Most of those products and services are not purchased at the destination, even though they are all consumed there; so there is a need for effective flows of information and highly co-ordinated action across a complex network that comprises producers, suppliers, purchasers and consumers to ensure that the ‘unseen’ product or service meets expectations.",6.98,40.41,13.50,9.51,0.64,25.07,43.55,32.67,39.26,53.07,81.55,3.74
"It is important to recognise the definitions proposed for SCM before analysing those specific to the tourism industry, particularly as there is no single, universally agreed definition. According to Mentzer et al. ( Furthermore, unlike traditional businesses, where the end product is tangible and can be taken home, tourism produces a tangible product but an intangible outcome - the customer experience (Smith and Xiao 2008).",5.14,50.45,29.25,3.09,2.44,7.89,49.83,16.45,79.12,51.12,64.91,5.22
"Presentations focused on the challenges of a carbon-neutral industry, and pointed in the direction of the greening of the industry (Orrain 2008). The concept is referred to in several places as a major objective of the plan, but with little elaboration of what a green economy will mean for Jamaica. When agriculture stakeholders were consulted, there was a general sense that the green economy concept was related to sustainable development in its attention to holistic development, environmentally-friendly economic processes of production and consumption, and socioeconomic equity (Rhiney 2012). At the same time, there was a widely shared scepticism that the term was just a new name for sustainable development, which was the current (2012) buzzword in the international community.",8.43,96.98,95.22,13.16,8.85,25.63,32.27,11.98,86.02,93.19,1.64,5.08
"Both of these new sectors were again based on natural resources. The bauxite mineral deposits were dug out of the soil in the hills of central Jamaica, and the hotels on the north coast of the island offered holiday-makers sun, sand and sea. Both were high-energy consumers, with the mining sector accounting for almost half of the national consumption of imported petroleum in some years. Government incentives stimulated investment in capital-intensive, import-dependent production of consumer goods. In the era of cheap energy, little attention was paid to the energy intensity of the production processes, especially because of the rapid growth of the domestic market for both basic consumption goods and luxury items for high-income households.",8.02,13.60,7.57,8.94,0.80,7.63,31.20,17.07,63.98,25.46,11.77,7.38

"This is another reason why poverty eradication, or at least alleviation, must be essential to a green economy strategy for Jamaica.

Costly adjustments to its standard of living will be instinctively resisted, unless there is a successful education programme on the long-term benefits of a green economy.",4.90,88.81,92.18,15.63,34.92,48.68,31.49,38.33,99.57,77.22,5.93,15.30
"With attempts to mainstream climate change in public policy now underway, there is more urgency to enhance attention to the environmental dimension of sustainable development.

"The government has been developing taxes and subsidies to shift relative prices especially to favour the use of renewable energy sources. There will still be the need for laws and regulations to complement market instruments in areas where competitive markets are not sufficiently developed, such as electricity and water. Several privately-operated recycling processes, such as deposits for glass bottles, collection of PET14 bottles and the collection of scrap metal, are well established. As in many countries, there is informal recycling by way of people prospecting for reusable materials in garbage containers and landfills.

"It is critical to reducing the national import bill and enhancing the international competitiveness of the economy’s export industries. This is probably a common problem shared by small developing countries that are dependent on imported petroleum. Indeed, it is arguable that even those that are endowed with petroleum would be wise to diversify their sources of energy, because their endowments of this non-renewable resource are limited and they have to share the responsibility of reducing the discharge of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Supplying organically grown food to the tourist industry will be yet another way of greening that industry.",7.21,94.93,94.35,20.84,46.33,26.41,49.26,70.27,86.74,90.26,91.98,56.19
"The service orientation will facilitate the transformation to a green economy in so far as there will be fewer practices, such as chemical applications, that are unfriendly to the natural environment; the energy intensity of production will decline; and information and communications technologies will be more easily applied to production. There is now an official commitment in the long-term plan, Vision 2030, to move towards a green economy, though it still is not the dominant thrust of the plan. Most important, investment in activities that use green technologies, such as wind and solar energy equipment and non-petroleum fuelled transport, is still marginal.",7.32,99.19,98.09,29.54,13.22,26.60,48.53,32.37,92.55,95.12,2.19,29.57
"Furthermore, it helps create new and decent jobs in new sectors. Governments around the world acknowledge that building green economies and green growth in the context of sustainable development can provide resilience to external shocks, reduce environmental risks, and protect and enhance the natural resource base of the economy, particularly in the context of small states. However, the current international discourse on green growth and the green economy has paid insufficient attention to the challenges of small states. Yet, several small states have begun conceptualising their pathways to a green economy, with different conceptualisations and approaches emerging. This chapter reviews the practical policy processes implemented in Mauritius to promote a green economy, and examines some of the benefits and challenges thereof. It consists of the main island of Mauritius and its dependencies, Rodrigues (560 km east-north-east), Agalega (930 km to the north), St Brandon (400 km to the north) and Tromelin (480 km to the north-west and jointly administered by France).",11.31,95.44,96.75,9.78,21.67,21.52,20.82,46.37,71.25,81.49,32.49,6.15
"Over 50% of MSW is biodegradable, which permits its usage as potential feedstock for production of biofuels, bioenergy, commodity chemicals. A person living in the OECD area generates on average 520 kg of waste per year; this is 20 kg more than in 1990, but 30 kg less than in 2000 (OECD, 2015).

"There are also examples at the national level. The Dutch Sustainable Growth Coalition, for example, unites the eighth largest big multinationals in shaping, sharing and stimulating sustainable business models. The changing role of business in society is also reflected in the increased participation by businesses in the discussions in various forums of the United Nations such as UN Global Compact, the development of the UN Sustainable Development Goals, as well as at international conferences such as the Rio+20 conference, which confirmed the importance of corporate sustainability reporting.

In addition, the IUCN governance structure could be used as a partial model for the post-2020 chemicals and waste management regime: the ICCM acts as the general assembly of members, and a governing council could be established to work under the direction and monitoring of the ICCM.",6.85,76.02,86.99,27.65,57.25,60.44,36.55,30.93,79.31,85.13,21.35,34.10
"Scientific findings and estimates have a remarkable influence on decision-making under the UNFCCC. A similar body could be created under the international chemicals and waste management regime. In general, duplication and extra costs should be avoided, and member states should seek ways to better utilize the existing scientific panels that focus on chemicals and waste.",4.45,39.48,58.70,19.12,37.61,45.20,16.88,28.58,36.07,60.28,7.44,10.38
"Since duplication of existing efforts should be avoided, a possible new panel should have clear additional value. A new scientific expert panel could create dialogue with scientists and policy-makers, to achieve the sound management of chemicals and waste at a global level. The results of the work of such a panel should be effectively fed into internationally relevant policy-making.",4.58,56.20,74.70,21.69,61.54,80.36,18.41,8.18,40.39,76.81,0.67,8.07
"Specialist commissions could be established if the post-2020 regime assumes scientific or policy study roles. The science-policy interface is well-developed under the ozone regime. Regular scientific assessments guide policy-makers: the Scientific Assessment Panel (SAP), the Environmental Effects Assessment Panel (EEAP), and the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel (TEAP) each prepare, about every 3-4 years, major assessment reports that update the state of understanding in their purviews.",5.60,13.55,44.77,6.95,8.35,7.69,3.49,11.02,41.82,53.67,1.68,4.01
"These product groups end up in mixed waste fractions to energy recovery or in waste fractions subject to recycling. The data presented is not always the most recent, but is regarded accurate enough to give an overall picture of the plastic waste streams in the studied countries and their quantities in relation to each other. A more detailed review of the existing collection and recycling systems for plastic waste in the Nordic countries is found in Frane et al. (",5.25,93.10,73.02,4.54,48.84,35.50,38.52,41.86,77.16,63.51,6.07,23.53
"Collection systems dedicated for plastic waste can be organised and practically operated in different ways dependent on the country, the legislation behind the collection and recycling, and the actors involved. Plastic waste can also be collected for recycling as part of another waste stream where the target fractions might not necessarily be plastics. This is the case for example end-of-life vehicles (ELVs) and Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE). The opposite is when the waste stream is meant to completely constitut of plastics, such as the plastic packaging waste stream.",6.36,82.93,73.48,11.78,17.68,53.41,46.97,51.53,53.74,59.22,8.39,25.11
"However, Hertwich and Peters (2009) state that 72% of global GHG emissions are related to household consumption, and the rest to government consumption and investments. The potential of mitigating climate change by changing consumption patterns is modelled by Girod and colleagues (2014), who propose that low GHG-intensive choices in housing, passenger transport, food, and other goods and services would make it possible to reach the 2 °C climate target by 2050. In addition to the end-of-pipe emissions of production, we should focus on the unsustainable footprint of our normal everyday life.",6.84,66.49,39.74,33.90,3.67,8.33,36.32,61.78,78.52,69.32,3.07,8.89
"Some of the brands are also designing products for ease of recycling, through avoiding fibre and material blends or design for ease of separation of different materials. These require not only designing of products from which materials can be recovered for the next generation, but also systems to collect post-consumer products. All the brands we spoke to have committed to moving more deeply into circular thinking in the future. For many the starting point has been to use readily accessible and consistent quality recycled fibres such as recycled PET or pre-consumer cotton waste from factories. Design for recycling may eventually lead to take-back systems, which once in place, can act as a catalyst for spreading closed-loop thinking to other products.",7.96,94.73,98.25,43.22,93.90,96.12,93.24,80.47,90.11,96.63,59.86,50.66
"There is a clear need for increased coordination and exchange of information between actors; in particular between designers/brands/producers and sorters/ recycling companies and technicians developing new recycling technologies (Elander & Ljungkvist, 2016). A reliable supply of recyclable used textiles needs to be secured and the demand for fibres, yarns and fabrics with recycled-content needs to be increased. Of special interest are examples of full closed loops. This is explained in more detail in the next chapter.",6.18,79.45,62.20,2.59,24.26,48.16,32.05,49.56,79.67,94.78,5.56,2.76
"Moreover, while reuse is thriving under charity-based collection and export systems, recycling options forthe non-reusable share, and especially textile to textile recycling are more restricted (Palm et al., These include pilot projects developing various methods for (chemical) recycling of fibres - e.g. Relooping Fashion in Finland and Re:newcell in Sweden - and R8<D projects on automated sorting of fibres as feed-in to recycling processes - e.g. SIPTex2 and Textile back to Textiles3 (Sweden), Textiles4Textiles (Netherlands) and FIBRESORT (Belgium). Others are system problems related to gathering and sorting sufficient quantities of recyclable used textiles and at the same time not offsetting environmental preferable reuse pathways (Elander & Ljungkvist, 2016).",9.87,89.03,76.68,8.34,6.17,61.06,62.27,58.88,73.83,78.28,3.22,11.10
"The graph is divided into four quadrants representing different shares of the recycling market between the informal and formal sector. The analysis suggested that a sustainable recycling system should grow towards the upper right hand corner of the graph, where most of the established recycling schemes in Europe and North America are currently located.

"This flow of e-waste further complicates problems associated with waste management.61 It is difficult to estimate the quantum of trans-border e-waste streams, as this trade in e-waste is camouflaged and conducted under the pretext of obtaining 'reusable' equipment or 'donations' from developed nations. Some exporters may deliberately leave difficult-to-spot obsolete or non-working equipment mixed in loads of working equipment through ignorance or to avoid more costly treatment processes. Consequently, this e-waste, which is hazardous, is being discarded and routinely burned in what environmentalists call "a cyber-age nightmare now landing on the shores of developing countries. It is one of Ghana's largest e-waste dumps, with mountains of abandoned motherboards, computer monitors, and hard drives littering the landscape.",9.15,7.27,30.83,4.14,4.00,9.38,42.44,20.24,38.94,18.02,0.65,7.35
"One immediate course of action would be to develop collection systems since these systems are often viewed as the backbone of any successful e-waste management system. In fact, informal collection systems were found to be rather efficient in countries like India and China because the daily informal collectors were able to penetrate each community and collect e-waste from house to house.57 The collectors were also able to earn reasonable pay; this in turn promoted a high collection rate. The box below depicts the results of this analysis.",5.88,48.93,26.48,1.87,25.11,70.09,18.32,11.16,16.72,24.93,5.73,1.74
"What had been an ad hoc development project quickly devolved into a scheme for companies in the West to cheaply dump dangerous garbage into ill-equipped and extraordinarily poor rural villages by sending unregulated shipping containers, marked 'donations', as a means to get around national regulations.66,67As a result of this unregulated dumping, Agbogbloshie's soil and water have high concentrations of lead, mercury, thallium, hydrogen cyanide, and PVC. Thus, it is often cheaper to ship outdated and damaged computers to developing countries under the 'donation' label than to recycle the electronics properly. However, as the Agbogbloshie case illustrates, the development of an effective e-waste strategy cannot be complete without appreciating the policy and regulatory governance frameworks that exist at the global, regional and local levels. Efforts must be made to ensure that the enforcement and compliance aspects of these policy and regulatory frameworks complement each other.",10.89,83.38,79.87,3.31,37.99,87.81,66.47,56.35,75.11,76.96,1.88,9.40
"In this regard, many initiatives have been started to assist those countries in tackling e-waste, develop ad hoc legislation, and raise awareness. In countries such Poland, Czech Republic, Hungary, and Bulgaria, collection and recycling are mainly led by the private sector. In the recent years, the collection rate in those countries has risen to approximately 46% of the estimated e-waste generated in 2016.",5.14,66.99,37.67,0.88,39.75,85.99,17.55,19.86,85.70,22.32,3.34,5.04
"The Ghana legislation prohibits imports and exports of e-waste, phases out the inclusion of printed circuit boards in electronic equipment, provides for the registration of manufacturers, importers, and distributors, as well as the establishment of an e-waste management fund to be achieved through payment of an advance eco-fund by manufacturers, importers, and distributors. Draft bills and regulations of many other African countries incorporate several of these features. Such approaches will integrate the informal sector into the official management structures, establish take-back schemes.",6.37,97.93,73.68,9.31,38.57,67.11,35.67,57.05,64.31,62.28,3.50,36.51
"Although the Balkans sub-region has not implemented an effective e-waste take-back system like the EU Member States, initiatives are undertaken mainly by the private recycling sector. Approximately 158 kilotons (kt) of e-waste is currently collected in the Balkans comparing to the 512 kt generated in 2016.

"An important ongoing effect is the increased miniaturisation of electronics.
